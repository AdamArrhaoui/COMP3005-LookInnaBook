This code runs on Python 3.11. It was tested on Windows but it should work fine for other OSes

# INSTRUCTIONS
1. Clone the repo to your device
2. Install all python modules listed in requirements.txt ```python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt```
3. Make sure you have a postgresql instance running with an empty database to test on
4. Run main.py
5. Login with your database credentials and database name. It should prompt you to run the DDL and DML files to setup the database
6. Enjoy the program (its self explanitory *i hope*)
